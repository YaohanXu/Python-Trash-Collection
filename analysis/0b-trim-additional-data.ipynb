While the violation types are highly descriptive, we note that terms like \"mice,\" \"roaches,\" and \"vermin\" are indicative of a restaurant's high vulnerability to trash mismanagement. Using a complete list of these indicative words, we filtered the dataset to include only trash-related conditions and stored it for further use."
